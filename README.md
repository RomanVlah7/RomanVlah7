About

I am an enthusiastic developer with a passion for creating clean, reliable code and well-thought-out architectural solutions. I have a strong experience in Java, which I have strengthened in practice, developing REST APIs, microservice systems with complex SQL queries and message brokers. I adhere to best practices in my work and actively apply them in my projects.

I am full of desire to grow, master new technologies and perfect my solutions. One day I want to create an application that will change the world - and I am already taking steps in this direction.
